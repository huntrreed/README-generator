 # README Generator

 
 
 ## Description
This project creates a README.md file from command line prompts. The prompts aim to answer all the main points that would need to be included in a README file and when all the answers to the prompts are submitted, it organizes the README file into a well-formatted, easy-to-read file with the users input showing in the appropriate locations.

## Installation
Make sure you have the Node application downloaded to your computer, have run the inquirer package (by typing npm init -y into the integrated terminal), and have VS code downloaded. From there you can open the file in VS code and it's fully functional. 

## Usage
The application is used by opening the index.js file, navigating to the integrated terminal, and typing "node index.js" in the command line, which will give you questions. Your responses to the questions will then be put in the final README file under their corresponding heading.

## Contributing Guidelines
The guidelines for this project were that the README was fully written through the command line, gives all the necessary questions to the needed sections in a README file, and that the table of contents in the README is fully functional. 

## Demo
Below is a demonstration of the application.

## Tests
You test this project by running the "node index.js" and answering the questions, then double checking that what you typed is what appears in the new README file. If there are issues with it, this will show up in the problems tab of the integrated terminal.
